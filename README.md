# CMAtoydata
This repository contains some examples of trial-length signals that can be correlated and analyzed using <a href="https://github.com/avspeech/cma-matlab">Correlation Map Analysis</a> (CMA). 
Additionally, a Matlab script calle corrmap_histogram.m, for computing the likelihood of positive and negative correlation between two signals is available. The signals in this directory, once converted to TimeSignals and submitted to CMA, can be quantitatively analyzed using this script.
